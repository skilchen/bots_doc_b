This allows you to select all files, or only\nspecific files, from the channel path. Some points to consider:\n\n\n\n\nMany types of channel (eg. ftp) are case sensitive. \n*\n.TXT is not\n    the same as \n*\n.txt\n\n\nFiles with and without extensions may be treated differently; \n*\n is\n    not the same as \n*\n.\n*\n\n\n\n\nfor \"safety\" you should use a partially specified name if possible.\n    This prevents accidentally picking up files that should not be\n    there. eg. use ORDER\n*\n.TXT rather than \n*\n.\n*\n For an in-channel\n    with type=file a wild-card can be used in the path.\n     If directory structure is like this:\n\n\n\n\nbotssys/infile/partner1\n\n\nbotssys/infile/partner2\n\n\nbotssys/infile/partner3\n\n\n\n\nuse path botssys/infile/\n*\n to read the files in all these directories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput filenames\n\n\n\n\nA unique name can be generated with an asterisk; the asterisk is\n    replaced by an unique number. Eg: order\n_*\n.edi -> order1.edi,\n    order2.edi, order3.edi etc\n\n\n(bots > = 3.0) Any \nta\n value can be used; eg. `{botskey},\n    {alt}, {editype}, {messagetype}, {frompartner}, {topartner},\n    {fromchannel}, {tochannel}, {idroute}.\n\n\n(bots > = 3.0) Date/time using \n{datetime}\n with any valid \ndate or\n    time format\n\n    specification; eg. \n{datetime:%Y%m%d}, {datetime:%H%M%S}\n etc.\n\n\n(bots > = 3.0) Incoming filename can be used (name and extension,\n    or either part separately); eg.\n    \n{infile}, {infile:name}, {infile:ext}\n\n\n\n\nWarning:\n Do not change out.ta_info['filename'] in your scripts.\n    Although it may appear to work, it messes up Bots internal file\n    storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome examples are shown in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChannel filename\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nExample filename generated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n or blank\n\n\ncreate a unique name, no extension\n\n\n39724\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*.txt\n\n\ncreate a unique name with .txt extension\n\n\n39724.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{botskey}.txt\n\n\nuse incoming \nbotskey\n value (eg. order number) with .txt extension. Note: {botskey} can only be used if merge is False for the messagetype\n\n\nBA7358-0.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{infile}\n\n\npassthrough incoming filename \n extension to output\n\n\nOrder001.edi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{infile:name}.txt\n\n\npassthrough incoming filename but change extension to .txt\n\n\nOrder001.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{editype}_{messagetype}_{datetime:%Y%m%d}_*.{infile:ext}\n\n\nuse editype, messagetype, date and unique number with extension from the incoming file\n\n\nedifact_ORDERSD93AUN_20120926_39724.edi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{frompartner}/{editype}/{infile}\n\n\nYou can also use subdirectories in the filename, but they must already exist. These will be appended to the path.\n\n\nKMART/edifact/Order001.edi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{frompartner}/INPUT/ORDER_{botskey}.csv\n\n\nFixed values can also be included as part of the directory structure or filename\n\n\nKMART/INPUT/ORDER_BA7358-0.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{overwrite}daily_report.txt\n\n\nForce overwriting of a file if it exists. \nUse this with caution; make sure it is really what you want!\n May be required on some sftp servers that do not support append mode.\n\n\ndaily_report.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{infile[4]}{infile[5]}{infile[6]}{infile[7]}.xml\n\n\nThis functionality uses the Python \nFormat String Syntax\n which does not have support for \"slicing\", but you can use this workaround to pick a range of single characters. \nBeware: this does not check for wrong string positions.\n\n\ninfile: \nINV_7389.txt\n generates: \n7389.xml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser scripting for output filenames\n\n\nBots has the capability to set output filenames with a\n\ncommunicationscript\n; however this requires a new\nscript for each channel and is somewhat complex.

They can greatly\ncomplicate grammars and mappings. Often your EDI partner will want to\nsend or receive XML with namespaces, but actually Bots does not need (or\nwant) them as there are rarely any naming conflicts within a single XML\nfile! \n\n\nWhere an XML file has only one namespace, usually the \"default\"\nnamespace is used.\n\neg. \nxmlns=\"schemas-hiwg-org-au:EnvelopeV1.0\n \n\n\nIf the file has multiple namespaces, then namespace prefixes are used. \nThese prefixes can be any value.\n\neg. \nxmlns:ENV=\"schemas-hiwg-org-au:EnvelopeV1.0\"\n \n\n\nThere are several ways to deal with namespaces in Bots:\n\n\n1. Ignore incoming XML namespace\n\n\nFor incoming XML files that are to be mapped into something else, you\nprobably don't need the namespaces at all. In my opinion this is the\n\"best\" way. See \nIgnore incoming XML\nnamespace\n\nfor an example preprocessing script to achieve this.\n\n\n2. Use incoming XML namespace\n\n\nWhen a namespace must be used, it is needed in many places (structure,\nrecorddefs, mapping) but you want to specify the namespace string, which\ncan be quite long, only in one place \n\n(DRY principle)\n. \nThis has several benefits:\n\n\n\n\nIf it needs to change, this is easy to do in one place only\n\n\ngrammar and mapping will be smaller, and look neater\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the incoming XML file may look like ...\n\n\n?xml version=\"1.0\"?\n\n\nOrders xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\n     xmlns=\"http://www.company.com/EDIOrders\"\n     targetNamespace=\"http//www.company.com/EDIOrders\"\n\n      \nOrder\n\n        \nOrderNumber\n239062415\n/OrderNumber\n\n        \nDateOrdered\n2014-02-24\n/DateOrdered\n\n        \nLineCount\n10\n/LineCount\n\netc...\n\n\n\nIf you created your grammar with xml2botsgrammar, it probably has the\nnamespace repeated over and over in structure and recorddefs, like\nthis...\n\n\nstructure=    [\n{ID:'{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}Orders',MIN:1,MAX:1,LEVEL:[\n    {ID:'{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}Order',MIN:1,MAX:99999,\n        QUERIES:{\n             'botskey':      {'BOTSID':'{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}Order','{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}OrderNumber':None},\n            },\n        LEVEL:[\n        {ID:'{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}OrderItems',MIN:0,MAX:1,LEVEL:[\n            {ID:'{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}OrderLine',MIN:1,MAX:99999},\n            ]},\n        ]},\n    ]}\n]\n\nrecorddefs = {\n   '{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}Orders':[\n            ['BOTSID','M',256,'A'],\n            ['{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}Orders__targetNamespace','C',256,'AN'],\n          ],\n   '{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}Order':[\n            ['BOTSID','M',256,'A'],\n            ['{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}OrderNumber','C', 20,'AN'],\n            ['{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}DateOrdered','C', 10,'AN'],\n            ['{http://www.company.com/EDIOrders}LineCount','C', 5,'R'],\n\n# etc...\n\n\n\nSo, we want to improve this. In your grammar, first add the namespace as\na string constant.

Think of eg splitting up a shipment to the\n    different orders. There are 2 ways of doing this:    Write multiple message to the same file.  Write each generated message to the same file, using alt translations.",

Scheduling is done by the scheduler of your OS. \n\n\n\n\nWindows: use eg \nWindows Task Scheduler\n.\n\n\nLinux/unix: use eg \ncron\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBots-engine does not run concurrently (in parallel). If a previous\n    run is still in progress, a new run will not start. From version 3.0\n    onwards, Bots includes an optional \njob queue server\n\n    to use when scheduling Bots engine. Using this is recommended, to\n    prevent discarding runs that overlap.\n\n\n\n\nStrong advice: when scheduling bots-engine, activate the sending of\n    automatic \nemail-reports for errors\n.\n\n\n\n\nPossible scheduling scenarios\n\n\n(command lines below are for Windows):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf all (or most) routes can be run on the same schedule, then just\n    schedule bots-engine \"new\" run as often as you need, Eg. every 5\n    minutes. To exclude some routes from this run, tick the\n    \nNotindefaultrun\n box in the route advanced settings. These can then\n    be scheduled separately by specifying route names on the command\n    line.\n\n\nc:\\python27\\python c:\\python27\\Scripts\\bots-engine.py --new\n\nc:\\python27\\python c:\\python27\\Scripts\\bots-engine.py \"my hourly route\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have few routes but with varying schedules, then schedule\n    them individually (by putting route names on the command line).\n    Disadvantage: newly added routes are not automatically run, you must\n    adjust your schedule.\n\n\nc:\\python27\\python c:\\python27\\Scripts\\bots-engine.py \"my orders route\" \"my invoice route\"\n\nc:\\python27\\python c:\\python27\\Scripts\\bots-engine.py \"my daily route\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider whether you need to schedule retries periodically.\n    Particularly with accessing remote servers, sometimes there may be\n    communication errors that would be ok next time bots tries.\n    Otherwise you will need to retry these yourself. File errors are not\n    retried automatically because the same error will just come up\n    again!\n\n\nc:\\python27\\python c:\\python27\\Scripts\\bots-engine.py --automaticretrycommunication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Setup (Mike)\n\n\nI am using Windows task scheduler and Bots \njob queue\n is\nenabled.

This\n    makes task configuration and changes easier; the scheduled tasks simply\n    call the batch files. Within the batch files I use job2queue.py for\n    adding jobs. Some add only a single job, while some add multiple jobs.\n    (You could also put the command lines directly into Windows task\n    scheduler, each one as a separate task). I use appropriate priorities\n    for each job, as some times of the day Bots can get very busy.

There is no fixed rule about this.\n\nSome argue that the edi-files are temporary information carriers and\nthat the real data is processed and archived in the ERP software of you\nand your edi-partner.\n\nBut:\n\n\n\n\nfor eg invoices there might be legal issues about keeping the\n    'original invoice'. Check this! (OTOH I get a big smile thinking of\n    legal/tax people wading though these EDI-files. ;-))\n\n\nit might be needed to keep the original in case there are any errors\n    or discrepancies that need to be investigated later.\n\n\n\n\nThe (default) 30 days of the current archive is a compromise between\n'keep all data always' and performance. If all data are kept,\nperformance will degrade in the long run.\n\n\nThe long term archive\n\n\nBots has an option for a long term archive.\n\nhow this works:\n\n\n\n\nPer channel: if you specify the 'Archive path' in a channel, all\n    files coming in or going out for that channel are archived.\n\n\nfor incoming files: archived as received (unchanged); for emails the\n    (un-mimified) attachments are saved.\n\n\nfor outgoing files: archived as send (unchanged). If outgoing\n    communication fails: nothing is send, so nothing is archived.\n\n\nThe long term archive contains copies of the files only. Once bots\n    has cleaned details from it's database you will need to use tools\n    like 'grep' to find what you need.\n\n\nBots creates a sub-directory per date, eg. myarchive_path/20131202,\n    myarchive_path/20131203, etc. The sub-directories contains the\n    edi-files archived in that day.\n\n\nWithin this daily directory, Bots uses unique numeric filenames by\n    default.\n\n\nEdi-files are kept 180 days in the long term archive (by default,\n    can be set via parameter \nmaxdaysarchive\n in\n    \nbots/config/bots.ini\n). Keeping files longer will not affect\n    performance significantly. Of course the files will occupy disc\n    space.\n\n\n\n\nExample of archiving\n\n\nArchive path for channel \nmy_inchannel\n is set to \nC:/edi/archive/my_inchannel\n.\n\nArchive path for channel \nmy_outchannel\n is set to \nC:/edi/archive/my_outchannel\n.  \n\n\nAfter a few days this will looks someting like:\n\n\n    C:/edi/archive/\n                  my_inchannel/\n                              20131202/\n                                      13892848\n                                      13892872\n                                      13892876\n                              20131203/\n                                      13892991\n                                      13893009\n                              20131204/\n                                      13893421\n                  my_outchannel/\n                              20131202/\n                                      13892861\n                                      13892886\n                              20131203/\n                                      13893123\n                              20131204/\n                                      13893479\n\n\n\n\nNote: it is strongly advised to archive the file outside of the bots\ndirectories!\n\n\nAdditional options for long term archive\n\n\n\n\n\n\narchiveexternalname (setting in \nbots/config/bots.ini\n). If set to True,\n  name of archived file is the name of the incoming/outgoing file. If this\n  name already exists in the archive: a timestamp is added to the\n  filename; eg. order.txt becomes order_112506.txt. External filenames\n  are only used for some channel types where the channel defines the\n  filename (file, ftp, ftps, ftpis, sftp, mimefile, communicationscript).\n  Default setting in bots.ini is False. New in version 3.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\narchivezip (setting in \nbots/config/bots.ini\n). If set to True, each\n  archive folder will be a zip file. If you keep archives for a long time,\n  zipping them can save a lot of disc-space; most EDI files compress to\n  just a few percent of original size. Disadvantage: harder to search.\n  Default setting is False. New in version 3.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser scripting for archive path. See\n  \ncommunicationscript\n. Note: please archive within\n  the archive path as set in channel, else the cleanup routines for\n  parameter \nmaxdaysarchive\n will not function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser scripting for name of archive file.

Please refer to the \nvirtualenv package\ndocumentation\n to understand\nwhat it does and how to install it. Virtual environments are not just\nfor Bots; you can use them for any other python development. That is why\nI started investigating this methodology.\n\n This guide is based on information from the following links.\n\n\nhttps://zignar.net/2012/06/17/install-python-on-windows/\n\n\nhttp://www.stuartellis.eu/articles/python-development-windows/\n  \n\n\nInstallation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall python: You have probably done this already! Make sure you\n    have the paths of your \npython27\n and \npython27\\scripts\n included in the\n    \nsystem path variable\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall distribute: Download \ndistribute_setup.py\n\n    and invoke it using python.\n\n\n python C:\\Path\\to\\distribute_setup.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Pip: Download\n    \nget-pip.py\n\n    (right click, save as) and invoke it using python.\n\n\n python C:\\Path\\to\\get-pip.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Virtualenv: Once Pip is installed, installing any other\n    package (that is available in the Python Package Index) is easy.\n\n\n pip install virtualenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall C and C++ compilers (optional): Not all python libraries are\n    pure python, some may contain C code that must be compiled to install\n    successfully. Download \nMinGW\n,\n    run it, and select the C and C++ compilers to install. When complete,\n    edit the file \nPython27\\Lib\\distutils\\cygwincompiler.py\n and remove\n    \n-mno-cygwin\n from lines 322-326. This flag is no longer supported. You\n    also need to add a setting to each virtual environment that needs to use\n    the compilers (described in the next section). Make sure you have the\n    path of your \nMinGW\\bin\n included in the \nsystem path\n    variable\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate your environments\n\n\nTechnically your virtual environments can be stored and scattered\nanywhere, but it makes sense to keep them all grouped together. I\nsuggest you create a \"root\" directory for environments, each environment\nwill be a subdirectory, eg.\n\n\nD:\\\n mkdir PythonEnv\nD:\\\n cd PythonEnv\nD:\\PythonEnv\n\n\n\n\nCreate as many environments as you need (for ease of use, keep\nenvironment names short but meaningful and without spaces), eg. bots310\n\n\nD:\\PythonEnv\n virtualenv bots310\nNew python executable in bots310\\Scripts\\python.exe\nInstalling Setuptools...........................................................\n............................done.\nInstalling Pip..................................................................\n.......................done.\n\nD:\\PythonEnv\n\n\n\n\nIf you installed compilers in the previous section and want to use them\nfor this environment, then edit \nLib\\distutils\\distutils.cfg\n within the\nenvironment folder, and add\n\n\n[build]\ncompiler=mingw32\n\n\n\nActivate and deactivate environments\n\n\nTo activate an environment, use the activate command in it's script\ndirectory. Notice your command prompt changes to show the active\nenvironment in brackets. Only one environment can be \"activated\" at a\ntime, in order to install modules etc.\n\n\nD:\\PythonEnv\n bots310\\scripts\\activate\n(bots310) D:\\PythonEnv\n\n\n\n\nTo deactivate the current environment, use the deactivate command.\nNotice your command prompt changes back to show no active environment in\nbrackets.\n\n\n(bots310) D:\\PythonEnv\n deactivate\nD:\\PythonEnv\n\n\n\n\nOptional; create an activate.bat file in your environment root\ndirectory. This gives you a shortcut to activate environments.\n\n\nREM activate.bat gives you a shortcut to activate python environments\nREM eg. activate bots310\ncall \"%1\\scripts\\activate\"\n\n\n\nInstall Bots in a virtual environment\n\n\nFirst, activate the required environment.\n\nInstall Bots and dependencies using pip (don't use the Bots Windows\ninstaller, because it installs to the default python folder!)\n\n\nInstall Bots from local downloaded .tar.gz file\n\n\n(bots310) D:\\PythonEnv\n pip install .\\bots-3.1.0.tar.gz\nUnpacking d:\\pythonenv\\bots-3.1.0.tar.gz\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package from file:///d7C%5Cpythonenv%5Cbots-3.1.0.tar.gz\n\nInstalling collected packages: bots\n  Running setup.py install for bots\n\nSuccessfully installed bots\nCleaning up...\n\n(bots310) D:\\PythonEnv\n\n\n\n\nInstall Django (version 1.4.x)\n\n\n(bots310) D:\\PythonEnv\npip install Django==1.4.6\nDownloading/unpacking Django==1.4.6\n  Downloading Django-1.4.6.tar.gz (7.7MB): 7.7MB downloaded\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package Django\n\nInstalling collected packages: Django\n  Running setup.py install for Django\n\nSuccessfully installed Django\nCleaning up...\n\n(bots310) D:\\PythonEnv\n\n\n\n\nInstall cherrypy (latest)\n\n\n(bots310) D:\\PythonEnv\n pip install cherrypy\nDownloading/unpacking cherrypy\n  Downloading CherryPy-3.2.4.tar.gz (424kB): 424kB downloaded\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package cherrypy\n\nInstalling collected packages: cherrypy\n  Running setup.py install for cherrypy\n\nSuccessfully installed cherrypy\nCleaning up...\n\n(bots310) D:\\PythonEnv\n\n\n\n\nInstall Genshi (optional, required for template-html output)\n\n\n(bots310) D:\\PythonEnv\n pip install Genshi\nDownloading/unpacking Genshi\n  You are installing a potentially insecure and unverifiable file.

This makes complicated scheduling much better/easier; scheduled jobs will not be dropped anymore.\n\n\nAdd: directory-monitor: start engine when file is dropped in directory.\n\n\nCleanup runs only once a day now (in the first run of day); better performance.\n\n\nCleanup now also runs VACUUM for sqlite; better performance.\n\n\nAll edifact, x12, tradacoms files go via mailbag, x12. This is simpler. (there is a compatibility option in bots.ini).\n\n\nSet max file-size in translations (value can be changed in bots.ini).

I find this very convenient.\n\n\nImprove: better sorting in configuration for in django 1.4, eg for routes, codelists, trasnlations.\n\n\nReferences in a configuration are better guarded. Eg: when deleting partner that is used in partner-specific translation: user is warned, has to confirm.\n\n\nImprove: removed charset from channel. This was not needed.\n\n\nImprove: selections in screens not only for partners but also for partner groups\n\n\nFix: download an edi-file via filer could give not-correct file.\n\n\nAdd: keep track of file-size of incoming/outgoing files.\n\n\n\n\nExtended partner functionality\n\n\n\n\nAdd: function 'partnerlookup' for use in mapping scripts to look-up/convert partner related functions.\n\n\nAdd: extra partner fields: address, user-defined fields.\n\n\nAdd: send a message to any bots partner from mapping script (use partners as the email address book).\n\n\nImprove: multiple email addresses in cc field.\n\n\n\n\nConfirmations\n\n\n\n\nFix: bug in confirmation logic for frompartner/topartner (I had them reversed...).\n\n\nBetter CONTRL-message.\n\n\nOption to run user exit either to generate CONTRL message or change the generated CONTRL message.\n\n\nmessagetype (for incoming) is now similar to other uses of message-type; edi-type is removed (is not needed)\n\n\nFix: better indexing for reference/botskey. This improves performance for confirmations.\n\n\n\n\nPlugins\n\n\n\n\nAlways make configuration backup when reading new plugin.\n\n\nDropped the date-indication for files that are overwritten.\n\n\nIndex file in plugin always starts with type of plugin and layout is sorted/predictable.\n\n\nFix for performance problem when generating plugin for big plugins.\n\n\nFixed bug for relations in database. Bug only occurs when reading 'hand-changed'-plugins.\n\n\n\n\nBetter handling of 'database is locked'/crash recovery\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all: use the jobqueue-server for more complicated scheduling (prevents running multiple engine!)\n\n\nDifferent way of detecting another instance of engine is running via locking of port.\n\n\nIf bots-engine finds no other engine is running, but the database is locked this indicates the previous run was ended unexpectedly (eg computer crash). In htis case bots will do an automatic 'crash recovery'. A warning is still given in logs or via email. Only ONE email is send.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical\n\n\n\n\nAn 64-bits installer for windows is available.\n\n\nRuns with django 1.4 now ; dropped support for django 1.1, 1.2\n\n\nDatabase has changed. A script is added to upgrade the database.\n\n\n\n\nOther changes\n\n\n\n\nAdd: startup script for bots-webserver using apache. Multiple bots-environments can run over one apache server.\n\n\nAdd: user exit for cleanup.\n\n\nImprove: use external file name in archive.\n\n\nAdd: archive as zip-files.\n\n\nFix: port was not used in initializing PostgreSQL.\n\n\nLess statuses in processing (simpler, faster).\n\n\nImprove: use unlimited text fields in database for errortext and persist.\n\n\nImprove: if message in incoming edi file has error in mapping script and/or writing outgoing file: process rest of edi file (there is a compatibility option in bots.ini).\n\n\nReworked errors for edi files (parsing, generating). All errors have numbers now (for referencing).\n\n\nAlways read incoming files sorted by name. Reason: predictability. Formerly the read order was not predicable.\n\n\nFix: better handling of import errors for user scripts. This could lead to confusing errors/situations.\n\n\nAdd: access to whole envelope in mapping.\n\n\nFix: nr of messages was not used correctly when writing multiple UNH in one mapping script.\n\n\nFix: bug for numerical fields with more than 4 decimal positions.\n\n\nAdd: counter(s) per bots-run in mapping script; eg useful for UNH/ST counter per interchange.\n\n\nFix: enveloping for edifact with keca-character-set.\n\n\nAdd: concatenate function for usage in mapping scripts.\n\n\nImprove: updated grammar-handling to allow for UNS-UNS construction.\n\n\nImprove: set explicit namespace when generating xml.\n\n\nAdd: determine translation via user scripting.\n\n\nAdd: user scripts can easy detect what type of run is done via routedict['command']\n\n\nDropped: intercommit connector.",

Reworked errors for edi files (parsing, generating). All errors have numbers now (for referencing).  Always read incoming files sorted by name. Reason: predictability. Formerly the read order was not predicable.  Fix: better handling of import errors for user scripts. This could lead to confusing errors/situations.  Add: access to whole envelope in mapping.  Fix: nr of messages was not used correctly when writing multiple UNH in one mapping script.  Fix: bug for numerical fields with more than 4 decimal positions.  Add: counter(s) per bots-run in mapping script; eg useful for UNH/ST counter per interchange.  Fix: enveloping for edifact with keca-character-set.

This means for you: edit a python source file (eg mappingscript, grammar), \n    save it and run again. No compilation, no linking.\n\n\nPython source files always have extension '.py'.\n\n\nIf you see a '.pyc' file: that is an intermediate file. OK, python does some compilation automatically. \n    Never mind, it is not important. Some systems have '.pyo' files instead. Again, not important.\n\n\nPython does not use curly braces ('{...}') or 'BEGIN...END' for functions, loops etc. Python uses \n    'indentation' instead. Some people love it, some hate it. For me: this is what I always did with all \n    programming languages; now everybody uses the same layout ;-))\n\n\nLinks to more learning about python are in the \npage with external links\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\nUse a good text editor. This is VERY important. It saves you a lot of time. See \nin tools page\n. Three main reasons:\n\n\na good editor has a feature called 'syntax highlighting'. This makes it is lot easier to work with eg mapping scripts.\n\n\na good editor can do a python syntax check on the python source file (a check if it is valid python). This will point \n    you directly to any errors you made.\n\n\nmake the editor use spaces instead of tabs. This is an important feature when working with python. Never mix tabs and spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating grammars and mapping scripts does not require an \"in depth\" knowledge of Python, but you need to \n    at least understand general principles of:\n\n\n\n\nvariables and expressions\n\n\nfunctions\n\n\nstrings\n\n\nlists\n, \ndicts\n and \ntuples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with a plugin or example\n\n\n\n\nmost grammars are \"similar\" (csv, fixed are simple; edifact, x12 are more complex)\n\n\nmost mappings are \"similar\" (same functions are used, only \"mpaths\" change)\n\n\nfind something close to what you need, see how it works, adapt it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling extra libraries/dependencies\n\n\n\n\nFor linux lots of \ninformation about installing libraries is here\n.
