## Introduction

> 	Definition: _A grammar is a description of an edi-message_.  
 	A grammar describes the records, fields, formats etc of an edi file.  
 	Bots uses grammars to parse, check and generate edi files.  
 	Grammars files are independent of the editype: a grammar for a csv
	files looks the same as a grammar for a x12 file.  
 	Grammar files are in: *usersys/grammars/editype/grammar name.py*\


### Learn grammar by example

Best way to get the idea of a grammar is to look at the (simple) example
in the chapter.

This CSV file:

    HEADER,ordernumber1,buyer1,20120524
    LINE,1,article1,24,description1
    LINE,2,article2,288,
    LINE,3.article3,6,description3

has this grammar:


    from bots.botsconfig import *        #always needed

    syntax = {                           #'syntax' section
    'field_sep' : ',',               #specify field separator
    'charset'   : 'utf-8',           #specify character-set
    }

    structure = [                        #'structure' section
    {ID:'HEADER',MIN:1,MAX:999,LEVEL:[   #each order starts with a HEADER record
    {ID:'LINE',MIN:1,MAX:9999},      #nested under the HEADER record are the LINE records, repeat up to 9999 times
    ]}
    ]

    recorddefs = {                       #'recorddefs' section
    'HEADER':[                           #specify the fields in the HEADER record
    ['BOTSID','M',6,'A'],            #BOTSID is for the HEADER tag itself
    ['order number', 'M', 17, 'AN'], #for each field specify the format, max length, M(andatory) or C(onditional)
    ['buyer ID', 'M', 13, 'AN'],
    ['delivery date', 'C', 8, 'AN'],
    ],
    'LINE':[
    ['BOTSID','M',6,'A'],
    ['line number', 'C', 6, 'N'],
    ['article number', 'M', 13, 'AN'],
    ['quantity', 'M', 20, 'R'],
    ['description', 'C', 70, 'R'],
    ],
    }


The example above is simple, but fully functional.


### Sections of a grammar

A grammar file consists of these sections:

-   syntax: parameters for the grammar like field separator, merge or
    not, indent xml, etc.
-   structure: sequence of records in an edi-message: start-record,
    nested records, repeats.
-   recorddefs: fields per record.
-   nextmessage: to split up an edi file to separate messages.
-   nextmessageblock: to split up a cvs-file to messages.

A section can be reused/imported from another grammar file.  
Purpose: better maintenance of grammars.  
Example: edifact messages from a certain directory use the same
recorddefs/segments:

     from recordsD96AUN import recorddefs

One edifact grammar consists of four parts. Example:

-   edifact.py (contains syntax common to all edifact grammars)
-   envelope.py (contains envelope structure and recorddefs common to
    all edifact grammars)
-   recordsD96AUN.py (contains recorddefs common to all edifact D96A
    grammars)
-   ORDERSD96AUN.py (contains structure specifically for ORDERS D96A)


### Problems for some edifact grammars on sourceforge site

Sometimes you might meet this error for a grammar:

> `GrammarError: Grammar "...somewhere...", in structure: nesting collision detected at record "etc etc".`
> This is the case eg with INVRPT D96A.  
> UN says about this that you have to make additional choices in
> message; either you make some segments mandatory or leave out some
> segment groups.  
> EANCOM did make such choices in their implementation guidelines.  
> So: you can not use the grammar directly, edit it according to your
> needs. This is according to what UN-edifact wants...
