## Splitting, merging and enveloping edi files

The advised way of working with bots is to have a translation work 
with a message (x12: transaction).  

In edi an incoming file will often have multiple messages.

And often you will have to have multiple outgoing messages in one
edi-file (merging, enveloping).
