## Using AS2 with Bots

### What is AS2

AS2 (Applicability Statement 2) is a specification about how to transport data 
securely and reliably over the Internet. Security is achieved by using digital
certificates and encryption.  
 
There are multiple forms of AS2, most used is AS2 over HTTP(S).  
AS2 (over HTTP) is a server protocol: to use AS2 you will need an
AS2-server. Each partner requires their own AS2 communications gateway.
All AS2 software is designed to be interoperable. There are several open
source implementations, as well as commercial software and hosted
services.
