## How does this 'run' thing work?

1. 	When you run bots-engine, each active route is run. 
1. 	Per route bots will perform all configured
	actions (read, translate, write): 
1. 	In bots-monitor you can view the results of the run(s), 
	the incoming edi-files, the outgoing edi-files,
	etc.

### Detailed explanation

![](RouteDiagram.png) 

All actions in the picture take place in the route 'myfirstroute'.  
The route contains:

-   an in-channel - fetches the incoming orders.
-   in the route is indicated that it should translate
-   an out-channel - transports the in-house orders to your file system.


When the incoming files have been read via the in-channel, bots starts
to translate:

-   bots parses the incoming file, using the information in the route:
    editype=edifact, messagetype=edifact.
-   as edifact is a standard bots can find out itself that the incoming
    edifact file contains order messages of messagetype
    ORDERSD96AUNEAN008
-   bots looks in the translation table (see
    *bots-monitor-\>Configuration-\>translations*) to find out what to
    do: what mapping script to use, to what editype and messagetype
    should be translated. In this case the mapping script
    'myfirstscriptordersedi2fixed' translates to editype 'fixed',
    messagetype 'ordersfixed'.
-   the mapping script is the heart of the translation. In the mapping
    script the data from the incoming message is fetched and place into
    the outgoing message.

A complete translation in bots needs:

Configure of the translation
(*bots-monitor-\>Configuration-\>Translations*).

A grammar for the incoming message. A grammar describes an edi-message:
the records, sequence of the records, fields in the records, field
lengths etc.

A mapping script. The mapping script gets data from the incoming message
and puts it in the outgoing message. A mapping script is a Python
script. You do not need to be proficient in Python to do this; only the
basics of Python are used. And Python is a relatively easy computer
language. There are a lot of good examples of mapping scripts in the
plugins.

A grammar for the outgoing message.
