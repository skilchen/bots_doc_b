## Configuration Files

Bots has two configuration files.  
Mostly the defaults will be OK to get started, but you may need to
customize these to your own needs.  
Settings are documented in the files.  
Open these files in your [text editor](UsefulTools.md).

The configuration files are located in the *bots/config* directory
(except when using [multiple
environments](DeploymentMultipleEnvironments.md).  
 The original default versions can be found in the *bots/install*
directory.
