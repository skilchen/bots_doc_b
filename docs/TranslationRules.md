## What translation when?

Bots figures out what translation to use via the translation rules.  
Best is to think of the translation rules as a 'lookup' table:

> look-up with (from-editype, from-messagetype, alt, frompartner and
> topartner) to find mappingscript, to-editype and to-messagetype


How the input values for the look-up are determined:

1.  editype
    -   configured in the route
    -   if you configure editype=mailbag, bots will figure out if
        editype is x12, edifact or tradacoms.

2.  messagetype can be:
    -   configured in the route, eg for editype csv
    -   for edifact, x12 and tradacoms: bots figures out the detailed
        messagetype. Example:
        -   in route: editype: edifact, messagetype: edifact\
        -   in incoming edi file bots finds detail messagetype
            'ORDERSD96AUN'.

3.  frompartner can be:
    -   configured in the route
    -   determined by the grammar using
        [QUERIES](GrammarsStructure#QUERIES.md)

4.  topartner can be:
    -   configured in the route
    -   determined by the grammar using
        [QUERIES](GrammarsStructure#QUERIES.md)

5.  alt can be:
    -   configured in the route
    -   determined by the grammar using
        [QUERIES](GrammarsStructure#QUERIES.md)
    -   set by mapping script in a [chained
        translation](TranslationAlt.md)


 Notes:

-   For frompartner and topartner: bots finds the most specific
    translation.
    -   Eg example with 2 translation rules:
        -   fromeditype = edifact, frommessagetype = ORDERSD96AUNEAN008
        -   fromeditype = edifact, frommessagetype = ORDERSD96AUNEAN008,
            frompartner=RETAILERX
    -   If bots receives an ORDERS message from RETAILERX, the 2nd
        translation is used.
    -   For other partners the first translation is used.

for alt-translations: only find the translation with that specific
'alt'.
