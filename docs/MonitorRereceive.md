## How to re-receive

Incoming files can be 're-received'.  
When re-receiving the (previously received) file is taken from the
archive, and re-processed.  
As the file from the archive is used, no (outside) communication is
used.

### Steps

1.  in the incoming screen, go to the start (in front of each line); a
    small menu will pop-up. Choose 'rereceive' from this menu. The file
    will be marked as 'rereveive'. Mark all files that you want to
    re-receive.
2.  Go to main menu-\>Run-\>Run user-indicated re-receives
3.  The engine will now start, and do all the re-receives you marked.


### Re-receive many files

As the files need to be marked one by one, this can be troublesome when
you need to re-receive many files.  

In the screen for incoming there is a button called 'Rereceive all'.
When you use this button all files in the selection are marked as
re-receive. This might take some while.  

Warning: **all** files in the selection are marked, not only the ones
visible on your page.

Tip: first make the right selection via the button 'Change Selection'.
Additional individual files can be marked/de-marked later.
