## Using partner groups
edi-partners can be assigned to groups.

This might come in handy:

-   partner dependent translations (in
    *bots-monitor-\>Configuration-\>Translations*). Select a group here,
    and translation is done for all members of the group.
-   partner-based filtering for routes/outchannel (in
    *bots-monitor-\>Configuration-\>Routes*): the outchannel is used for
    all members of the group.
-   in selections you can use partner-groups.  
    Note: partner-groups do not work for confirmations.



### How to

1.  Create a group in *bots-monitor-\>Configuration-\>Partners &
    groups*. Indicate it is a group using tick-box 'Isgroup'.
2.  For the partners in a group, assign them to this group using 'Is in
    groups'.



### Plugin

Plugin 'demo\_partnerdependent' at [the bots sourceforge
site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/plugins/) demonstrates
partner-groups.
