## Build a good test-set 

When you do changes in your edi environment, you want to know that every 
'ran as before'. What can be helpful for this is to use a 
[isolated acceptance test](DeploymentAcceptance.md) for this.

This is easy to demonstrate:

-   Download a plugin from [bots sourceforge
    site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/plugins/) and
    install it (not on your production environment;-))
-   In *config/bots.ini* set 'runacceptancetest' to True
-   Run bots-engine via command-line


How this works: in acceptance tests an extra script
*usersys/routescripts/bots\_acceptancetest.py* runs when all routes are
finished. This script does 2 things:

-   It compares the results (\#files received, errors, send, etc) with
    the expected results. If results are different you'll see this (on
    command-line window).
-   The files in *botssys/infile/outfile* are compared with files as
    generated by the run in *botssys/outfile*. If results are different
    you'll see this (on command-line window).


Some things to look at when you build a test-set:

-   Use the 'acceptance test path' in the channels to point to your file
	system for incoming and outgoing channels (prevents using communication
	methods like pop3, ftp, etc).

-	Test file in *botssys/infile* are added to plugins (I find this very
	convenient).

-	Counters (for message numbers, file names etc (via unique()) are the
	same in every run, so results are the same every run.\

-	If date/times need to made, use transform.strftime() for this; it is
	like pythons time.strftime() but gives always the same date/time in
	acceptance testing.
