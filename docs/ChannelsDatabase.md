## Direct database communication 

Bots can read and write from a database.  
See plugin demo\_databasecommunication on the [bots sourceforge
site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/plugins/).


### Discussion: direct database communication or not

In most edi setups there is no direct database communication, but an
intermediate file is used:

-   inbound edi: bots translates edi files to your import format
-   outbound edi: the export files of your application are translated by
    bots to the wished edi format.

Reasons to set up edi using an intermediate file:

-   it is better to do the import/export with the tools you are familiar
    with, and not to use a new tool (knowledge, maintenance).
-   different edi partners do use different standards (dialects of the
    standards, different interpretations, different countries, different
    sectors, edi standards are not that good). Try to use one
    import/export format; let the edi software handle the differences
    between partners.

Reasons to use direct database format:

-   import/exports are very simple/straightforward
-   your system does not (yet) have good functionality for handling the
    incoming edi data. Example: receive sales reports, but what to do
    with this? This data is quite simple, just import this in one (new)
    table. The users can query this table for information.


### Inbound edi (write to database)

-   Translation rule should be to edi-type 'db'
-   In the mapping script: out.root should be a python object (dict,
    list, class, etc); this object is passed to the actual database
    connector.
-   Outgoing channel should be type 'db'.
-   Use a communication script for the outgoing channel
    (usersys/communicationscripts/channelname.py). This communication
    script does the actual communication with the database.
-   In the communication script should be 3 functions:
    -   connect - build database connection.
    -   out-communicate - put the data in the database using the data as
        received from the mapping script.
    -   disconnect - close database connection.
-   Use the database connector as needed, eg: python provides by default
    the sqlite3 connector, mysql-Python as MySQL database connector,
    psycopg2 as PostgreSQL database connector, etc


### Outbound edi (read from database)

-   Incoming channel should be type 'db'.

-   Use a communication script for the incoming channel
    (usersys/communicationscripts/channelname.py). This communication script
    does the actual communication with the database.

-   In the communication script should be 3 functions:

    -   connect - build database connection.
    -   incommunicate - fetch the data from the database, send it to the
        mapping script.
    -   disconnect - close database connection.

-   Use the database connector as needed, eg: python provides by default the
    sqlite3 connector, mysql-Python as MySQL database connector, psycopg2 as
    PostgreSQL database connector, etc

-   Translation should be from edi-type 'db'

-   In the mapping script: inn.root is the data as received from the
    database connector.

-   Note: the data passed from the communication-script can be any python
    object (eg dict, list). If a list (or tuple) is return from the
    communication script, bots passes each member of the list as a separate
    edi-message to the mapping script.
