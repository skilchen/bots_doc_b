## Partner specific translation 

### Explain by example
You receive edifact ORDERSD96AUNEAN008 from several partners. Partner
'retailer-abroad' fills the orders in a different way; the difference is
so big that it is better to have a separate mapping script.

Configure this like:

-   one grammar for incoming edifact ORDERSD96AUNEAN008 message. (It is
    a standard message, isn't it?)
-   one grammar for the inhouse import format. (We definitely want one
    import for all orders!)
-   note that the incoming edifact grammar uses QUERIES to determine the
    from-partner and to-partner before the translation.
-   make the 2 mapping scripts:
    -   mapping script 'ordersedi2inhouse\_for\_retailerabroad.py'
        (specific for partner 'retailer-abroad').
    -   mapping script 'fixed-myinhouseorder' (for all other
        retailers).
-   add 'retailer-abroad' to partners (via
    *bots-monitor-\>Configuration-\>Partners & groups*).
-   Use 2 translations rules:
    -   edifact-ORDERSD96AUNEAN008 to fixed-myinhouseorder using mapping
        script ordersedi2inhouse.py
    -   edifact-ORDERSD96AUNEAN008 to fixed-myinhouseorder using mapping
        script ordersedi2inhouse\_for\_retailerabroad.py for
        from-partner 'retailer-abroad'

Often there are lots of similarities between the mappings - the 'many
similar yet different mappings' problems. This can be [handled in
bots](TranslationperPartnerExtended.md)
in a nice way.


### Plugin

Plugin 'demo\_partnerdependent' at [the bots sourceforge
site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/plugins/) demonstrates
partner specific translations.
