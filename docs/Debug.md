## Standard: via bots-monitor

-   the reports-screen gives an overview of what happened in a run. 
-   if there are process errors in a run, first view the process errors! 
-   the incoming-screen gives information about the results of each incoming file
-   for each incoming edi-file: view the detail-screen for information about the processing
    steps for incoming/outgoing edi file (in incoming-screen move your mouse
    to the star at the start of the line, a drop-down box will appear,
    choose 'details'.
-   view the outgoing files, including communication errors for outgoing files.

### Extended debug options

Note: the errors bots gives for incoming edi-files are quite accurate;-))

-   in config/bots.ini there is the parameter get\_checklevel. Set to to
    2 for developing. Than all gets/puts are checked with the
    grammar(s).

    > For production use 1 (does sanity checks on get/puts) or 0 (which
    > is fastest, but if errors gives probably strange error-messages).

-   if wished, use extended errors: parameter 'debug' in
    [bots.ini](StartConfigurationFiles.md); gives information about the
    place in the code where the error occurred.
-   logging. Logging can be found in botssys/logging. Parameters in
    [bots.ini](StartConfigurationFiles.md) can be set to get more debug
    information:
    -   log\_file\_level: set to DEBUG to get extended information.\
    -   readrecorddebug: information about the records that are read and
        their content.
    -   mappingdebug: information about the results of get()/put() in
        the mapping script. Note: in bots 3.0.0 this does not work
        (bug). Fix: in botsinit.py, line 188 should be:
        botsglobal.logmap = logging.getLogger('**engine.map**')
-   extended log information for some communication protocols in
    [bots.ini](StartConfigurationFiles.md): ftpdebug, smtpdebug,
    pop3debug. This debug-information is on the console/command line.
-   within a mapping script (or other user script) use 'print', output
    can be viewed on the console/command line.
-   use root.display() to see message content in mapping script:
    -   incoming messages: at the start of the main function
        *inn.root.display()*
    -   outgoing messages: at the end of the main function:
        *out.root.display()*

> root.display() is not the nicest output, but is definitely what you
> receive/have generated.


### Tips for debugging

-   if a run has process errors, first check the process errors!
-   Be careful with character-set/encoding:
	-   Can your editor handle this? Be careful with editing files and
    	saving these again, you might run into issues with
    	character-set/encodings!
	-   Are you familiar with the character-set you use? Are you familiar
    	with eg utf-8? If not, please check this first.

-   in reality, edifact and x12 messages contains errors. Especially when
    'found on internet'; lot of ISA headers for X12 are not OK!
