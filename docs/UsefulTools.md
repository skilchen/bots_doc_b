## Useful tools for working with Bots

These are programs you can use in bots development and deployment. (please add more)\

### Text Editors

Any text editor you use should have syntax colouring/highlighting. This
makes it much easier to spot any mistakes. It is also good to be able to
run python to do syntax checks. Also a good search/replace function (eg
to add extra CR/LF in edifact or x12 files).


-   **[EditPlus](http://www.editplus.com/index.html)** (Windows) is the
    editor I have used for many years and so continued to use it with
    Python. There are no python syntax files in the default installation
    but you can easily [download](http://www.editplus.com/javacpp.html)
    and add them, several versions are available. You can also add a
    "user tool" option to run a python syntax check directly in the
    editor, and one to run the bots grammar check.
-   **[Scite](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html)** (Windows, Linux)
    provides Python syntax highlighting and python syntax check directly
    in the editor to check the correctness of Python scripts.
-   **[Geany](http://www.geany.org/)** (Windows, Linux) provides Python
    syntax highlighting and python syntax check directly in the editor
    to check the correctness of Python scripts. Quite similar to scite,
    but more fancy eg with spell checking. Web site calls it an IDE.
-   **[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)**
    (Mac) provides Python syntax highlighting and python syntax check
    directly in the editor to check the correctness of Python scripts.
    Also quite similar to Scite, very interesting access to remote
    scripts via SSH/SFTP.


### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

These are a "step up" from just using a text editor. Please add more if
you have anny experience with these.


-   **[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/indigosr2)**
    with [PyDev](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/node/114). You just
    create a project in the bots directory and edit everything from that
    folder.


### Compare and merge

Tool for comparing files and directories, analyse changes and copy code
changes eg between test and production environments.

-   **[Winmerge](http://winmerge.org/)** (Windows)
-   **[Meld](http://meldmerge.org/)** (linux)
-   **[Tkdiff](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdiff/)**
    (windows,linux)
-   **[KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/)** (linux)



### Database

-   **[SQLite Expert](http://www.sqlite.org/)** (Windows, Linux) is a
    database browser tool for SQLite. Useful for advanced
    troubleshooting or learning more about Bots internal workings. You
    can use SQL commands to do quick updates or create reports. Note: I
    use an old version (1.7) as the newer versions are much larger and
    slower and offer nothing more useful.
-   **[HeidiSQL](http://www.heidisql.com/download.php)** (Windows) can
    be used similarly to the above for bots installations using the
    MySQL database. A lightweight interface for managing MySQL and
    Microsoft SQL databases. It enables you to browse and edit data,
    create and edit tables, views, procedures, triggers and scheduled
    events. Also, you can export structure and data either to SQL file,
    clipboard or to other servers.
-   **[MySQL Workbench](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)**
    (multiple platforms) is the full blown MySQL management toolset. It
    provides an integrated tools environment for Database Design &
    Modeling, SQL Development (replacing MySQL Query Browser) and
    Database Administration (replacing MySQL Administrator). The
    Community (OSS) Edition is available from this page under the GPL.



### Other tools


-	**[IZArc](http://www.izarc.org/)** (Windows) is an archive tool that
	allows you to open bots plugins (zip files) and easily modify their
	contents.
-	**[BareTail](http://www.baremetalsoft.com/baretail/)** (Windows) is a
	free real-time log file monitoring tool. It is useful for watching Bots
	log files (engine.log, webserver.log etc). Multiple tabbed interface,
	colour highlighting, single small program, no installer.
