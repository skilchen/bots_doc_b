## delete(mpath)

Delete(s) the record(s) as specified in mpath in the outmessage 
(and the records 'under' that record).  
After deletion, searching stops (if more than one records exists for
this mpath, only the first one is deleted). For deleting all records
(repeating records) use getloop() to access the loop, and delete within
the loop.  
Returns: if successful, True, otherwise False.

    #delete a message date in a edifact INVOICD96AUNEAN008:
    out.delete({'BOTSID':'UNH'},{'BOTSID':'DTM','C507.2005':'137'}) 
    #delete DTM record where field C507.2005 = '137' ; DTM-record is nested under UNH-record.

    #delete all ALC segments in edifact message:
    while message.delete({'BOTSID':'UNH'},{'BOTSID':'ALC'}):
        pass

Note: If you want to delete a field, you can use the change option and
put as value "None":

    lot = lin.get({'BOTSID':'line','batchnumber':None})
    if not lot == None:
        lin.change(where=({'BOTSID':'line','batchnumber':lot},),change={'batchnumber':None})
    #In this case I want to remove a wrong batchnumber from a specific supplier

### change(where=(mpath),change=mpath)

Used to change an existing record. 'where' identifies the record,
'change' are the values that will be changed (or added is values do not
exist) in this record.

Only one record is changed. This is always the last record of the
where-mpath  
After change, searching stops (if more than one records exists for this
mpath, only the first one is changed). For changing all records
(repeating records) use getloop() to access the loop, and change within
the loop.

    inn.change(where=({'BOTSID':'UNH'},{'BOTSID':'NAD','3035':'DP'}),change={'3035':'ST'}) 
    #changed qualifier 'DP' in NAD record to 'ST'

Note: where must be a tuple; if you want to change the root of document,
add a comma to make it a tuple.

    inn.change(where=({'BOTSID':'UNH'},),change={'S009.0054':'96A'})
    #                                 ^ note comma here
