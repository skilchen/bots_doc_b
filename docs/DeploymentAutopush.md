## Recipe to push test-\>production (bots\>=3.0)

Recipe to use a standard [directory comparison
tool](UsefulTools.md#Compare\_and\_merge.md) to manage the differences in
configuration between test and production: 

1. 	For both environments,
	make configuration index file (menu-\>Systasks-\>Make configuration
	index) 
1. 	Compare both environments using a [directory comparison
	tool](UsefulTools#Compare\_and\_merge.md). What you should compare
	is: 
    -	All files in _bots/usersys_. 
    -	Note that the file
		_bots/usersys/index.py_ contains the configuration as in the database
		(routes, channels, partners). 
1. 	Push changes using such a directory comparison tool. 
1.	And read configuration index file (menu-\>Systasks-\>Read configuration
	index) to the database.

### Details

1.	if the configuration index file is generated all configuration is in
	usersys (routes, mappings, partners etc).

1.	By using the 'isolated acceptance test' both environments can be 'very
	equal'.

1.	The configuration index file can also be generated by command line tool.

1.	Look like it is possible to use a version control system. I have not
	tried it, but recipes and experiences are welcome!
